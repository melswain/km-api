## üî® Project Overview

### Keyboards and Mice API

This web service provides information about keyboards and mice available on the market, along with information regarding their layouts, buttons, switches, vendors, and more. It provides filtering options to obtain all of this information!

### Tech Stack

- Framework: Slim
- Languages: PHP
- Tools: Composer
